The user account <b><%= @user.display_user_name %></b> was just removed from the supported list by an organization.
<% if @org %>
  The organization <b><%= @org.settings['name'] %></b> removed you from their list of supported users.
<% end %>
Organization managers will no longer have access to your usage reports and logs.<br/><br/>

<% if @user.expires_at %>
If the organization was sponsoring your account, then please keep in
mind that they are no longer funding your premium account.
That means you'll need to find another sponsoring organization or set up 
payments yourself in order to not lose premium account access. 
<% if @user.expires_at > Time.now %>
  You have <b><%= time_ago_in_words(@user.expires_at) %></b> to get things figured out
  before your premium account expires.
<% end %><br/><br/>
