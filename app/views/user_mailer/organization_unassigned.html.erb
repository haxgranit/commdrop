The user account <b><%= @user.display_user_name %></b> was just removed from the sponsored list by an organization.
<% if @org %>
  The organization <b><%= @org.settings['name'] %></b> removed you from their list of sponsored users.
<% end %>
Organization managers will no longer have access to your usage reports and logs.<br/><br/>

The organization is also no longer funding your premium subscription.
That means you'll need to find another sponsoring organization or set up 
payments yourself in order to not lose premium account access. 
<% if @user.expires_at > Time.now %>
  You have <b><%= time_ago_in_words(@user.expires_at) %></b> to get things figured out
  before your premium account expires.
