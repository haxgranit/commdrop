<%= @user.settings['name'] %> -- Welcome to CoughDrop! We're excited that you've signed
up to use what we think is the most flexible, usable communication tool out there! We 
built CoughDrop to make things easier for 
communicators and the support teams around them, so we hope the app can make a 
difference for you.<br/><br/>

You've signed up for an account with the user name <b><%= @user.display_user_name %></b>.
To finish registering just
<a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/confirm_registration/<%= @user.registration_code %>">open this link in your web browser of choice</a>.
<% if @user.grace_period? %>CoughDrop comes with "cloud extras" features that include
logging, reports, goals and badges, and your CoughDrop account will have access to these
features through <b><%= @user.expires_at.to_s(:long_ordinal) %></b>. Don't worry, we won't 
automatically start billing you after that unless you decide to purchase :-).<% end %>
<br/><br/>

CoughDrop has a lot of great features, from eye tracking to switches to reports to badges, but 
those features are all more than happy to
wait patiently until you're ready for them. You can
find walkthroughs and guides on the simple and advanced features available in the CoughDrop app
by visiting
<a href="https://coughdrop.zendesk.com">our support site</a> or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSVyFzvGVeFSOS7TP06re1g">our YouTube channel</a>. 
You can also <a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/contact">shoot us a message</a>
there is you think something might be broken.<br/><br/>

If you ever find something you think could be improved upon, we'd love
to hear about it, so please <a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/contact">contact us</a>! 
Our goal is to build something that can help enable communicators to succeed,
and we're always looking for new ways to make that happen!<br/><br/><br/>

Thanks!<br/>
-The CoughDrop Team
