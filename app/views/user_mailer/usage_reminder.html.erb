Hello again, and thanks for joining CoughDrop! We wanted to take just
a minute and make sure you knew about some of the powerful tools you have 
access to with your CoughDrop account, so you can get the most out of
your experience. This is a one-time email that you'll hopefully find helpful.<br/><br/>

  <h3>Supervising</h3>
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coughdrop/email/supervisor.png" style="float: right; width: 300px; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 2px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="supervisor screen shot"/>
  It looks like you've signed up as a supervisor, but you don't have anybody to supervise.
  Once you've been added by communicators as a supervisor, you'll see their information
  show up on your dashboard, including notifications, recent logs, and quick actions for
  things like loading their boards and reports, or even firing off a quick assessment! We're
  always working to make things better, so keep an eye out for additional improvements here.

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coughdrop/email/board.png" style="float: right; width: 300px; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 2px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="board screen shot"/>
  If you haven't had much chance to use CoughDrop yet, remember that it's a
  simple, flexible communication app that gives you unique insights into what's working.
  It's easy to get started, just pick a home board, open it in Speak Mode and start
  talking! You can always use one of the suggested starter boards, or create your own.
  And don't forget that you can connect supervisors to a communicator's account, and 
  then everyone can see the boards and reports on their own devices too!

  <h3>Doing More</h3>

  CoughDrop is more than just a communication app, it's a movement. We're trying to show
  everyone just how much of a different flexible, team-enabled resources can be
  in helping communicators make their voices heard. Your
  support helps make that happen, so thank you for joining us. We're constantly working 
  with experts to find ways to
  improve the app to better support the many different communication strategies that are out
  there. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please don't hesitate to share!

  <h3>Logging</h3>
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coughdrop/email/reporting.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 2px; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 5px;" alt="reporting screen shot"/>
  CoughDrop has powerful reporting and logging built-in. Once you 
  <a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/stats">turn on logging</a> 
  then any usage that happens will be automatically gathered into detailed
  reports and summaries. The communicator and their support team can see things
  like what time of day communication is happening, what types of speech are being
  used and where on the screen buttons are being pressed, all with the goal of working
  toward better communication strategies.
