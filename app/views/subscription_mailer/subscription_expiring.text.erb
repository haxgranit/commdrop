This is a notice that the user account "<%= @user.user_name %>" needs updated billing information. There was an error handling the current billing information, either the card failed multiple times or the account was manually canceled, or something unexpected occurred.

To address this problem please update your billing settings in <%= app_name %>:

<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/subscription?confirmation=<%= @user.registration_code %>

If you need more time on your trial or think this message was sent in error, please let us know and we'll help get to the bottom of things. Just contact us (<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/contact) to make a request.

Thanks!
