Hello! We wanted to reach out and make sure you know that your 
<%= @user.grace_period? ? "free trial" : "premium access" %>
for
the CoughDrop user account <b><%= @user.user_name %></b> will conclude soon. 
Hopefully CoughDrop has been a useful tool and you're excited to 
keep using it. We're constantly working with experts to make CoughDrop easier
and more informative, and it'd be great to have you along for the ride.<br/><br/> 

Remember, your purchase doesn't just help you or the communicators you work with, 
it also goes to help fund communicators in need, and to help push technology 
forward for the thousands of communicators in need around the world!
If you don't need CoughDrop right now, don't worry, you won't
be automatically billed or anything, and your account will stay here waiting for you
in case you decide to pick it up again later.<br/><br/>

Your account is set to expire <b><%= @user.expires_at.to_s(:long_ordinal) %></b>. 
Please 
<a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/subscription?confirmation=<%= @user.registration_code %>">update your billing settings</a> 
so that you don't miss out on the great resource CoughDrop can be to help
struggling communicators.<br/><br/>

If you need help finding a funding solution, please don't be afraid to reach out to us, 
we're willing to work with individuals to find a good solution. Just 
<a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/contact">contact us</a>
and we'll be happy to work with you.<br/><br/>

Thanks!<br/>
-The CoughDrop Team
