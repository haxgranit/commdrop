Thank you for using CoughDrop, *<%= @user.user_name %>*! You recently upgraded your plan to include access to premium symbols within CoughDrop! We work hard to provide everyone with the resources they need to help communicators succeed, so we're excited to provide  this additional option as a resource for everyone.

To start using the premium symbols, all you need to do is edit a new or existing board, or Swap Images on an existing board, and select the premium library you'd like to use for your symbols. After you use it once, your device will remember which library is your preference and start using it by default for new edits.

If you need help, feel free to check out our CoughDrop usage guides (https://coughdrop.zendesk.com) for walkthroughs of common tasks, or to shoot us a message if you need help or think something might be broken.

Thanks again for signing up for CoughDrop! We hope you enjoy using the tool, and please don't hesitate to let us know if you think of anything we could do to make things easier.

Thanks!
-The CoughDrop Team
