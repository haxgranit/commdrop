This is a notice that the user account "<%= @user.user_name %>" needs updated subscription information. We tried to auto-resume the subscription settings you had on hand before, but for some reason it failed.

To address this problem please update your subscription settings in CoughDrop:

<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/subscription?confirmation=<%= @user.registration_code %>

If you need help or think this message was sent in error , please let us know and we'll help get to the bottom of things. Just contact us (<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>) to make a request.

Thanks!
