subscription information. We tried to auto-resume the subscription settings you had
on hand before, but for some reason it failed.<br/><br/>

To address this problem please 
<a href="<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/subscription?confirmation=<%= @user.registration_code %>">update your subscription settings in CoughDrop</a>.<br/><br/>
